# MC-AIXI-CTW reimplementation

Re-implementation of the MC-AIXI-CTW agent by Veness et al as described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801)

This is a fully general reinforcement learning agent which can learn to succeed in any environment (given enough computational resources....) .

To compile the agent, run the makefile, then the ```agent``` executable.

For a detailed description of the project, please see ```README.pdf```

This project was completed with the help of Joseph Meltzer, Xi Du, and Tianyu Wang
